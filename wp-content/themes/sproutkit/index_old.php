			<p>In 2014 I lost my job. It sucked, but I figured I would get another job in the next couple of weeks so it was no big deal. 6 months later I was still without a job. I guess I wasn&rsquo;t as good at job interviews as I thought.</p>
			<p>Either way I needed to hold up my end of the bargain with regards to bringing in some family income.</p>
			<p><strong>I like the idea of a Sugar Mama as much as the next person</strong>, but my wife wasn&rsquo;t too enthused with the idea.</p>
			<p>I needed to do something quickly so I decided I was going to write a book on iOS Design.</p>
			<p>Why?</p>
			<p>Because I liked designing iOS apps.</p>
			<p>I wasn&rsquo;t the best iOS designer around, but I knew I had done enough to share my experiences and process.</p>
			<p>So I set about creating my first online course. <strong>I really had no idea what I was doing and I was winging it as I went along.</strong></p>
			<p>In 3 weeks I had gotten a first draft done and I thought it would be cool to put it online. I knew it would help some people, but I was terrified of charging anything.</p>
			<blockquote class="pull-quote">
				<p>I wanted to make some money, but was uncertain how much people would pay so I decided that I would allow people to pay whatever they want. In the first week the book was viewed by over 5,000 people.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Surely that meant I made a killing from all the generous people who paid a fair price to read the book, right?</p>
			<p>Wrong.</p>
			<p><strong>I made $124. From 5,000 people. Pathetic.</strong></p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s $0.40 a person.</p>
			<p>Not really what I had in mind so I had to do something else. I knew that I had a decent audience now from all the people that read the book so I decided I would create an online course that supplemented the book.</p>
			<h2 class="text-center"><em>This Is Where Things Change</em></h2>
			<p>Again, I had no idea what I was doing and instead of spending weeks developing the course to find out that nobody wanted it, I decided I would put it up for pre-sale. It went up on a Friday and by Sunday night I had made $3,000 for something that didn&rsquo;t even exist yet!</p>
			<p>That is the weekend that changed my life. Since then I&rsquo;ve been making money through my <a href="https://makerscabin.com" target="_blank">online school</a>. Everything hasn&rsquo;t been roses, but I&rsquo;ve learned what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
			<p>A lot of my students ask me can you make a living by creating online courses and the answer is yes. Before the last <em>real</em> job I had, I ran a web design blog that was my only source of income. If there is a way to make money online I&rsquo;ve probably setup a website for it.</p>
			<p><strong>In the past 18 months I&rsquo;ve made $210,000 from my online businesses.</strong></p>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t say that number to brag. In fact, when I see that number I get upset because it should be 3-4x that if I had done things right the first time.</p>
			<p>Lesson learned I suppose.</p>
			<p>More importantly I&rsquo;ve done it the way I want. No fancy tricks or scams. I just worked on building good brands that people trust. Built relationships and let the rest take care of itself.</p>
			<h2 class="text-center"><em>Now I&rsquo;m Teaching My Wife...and You</em></h2>
			<p>I used to live in Los Angeles. While there my wife ran a successful dog walking business. She was making between $4,000 - $6,000 a month walking dogs! It was awesome...until I decided we were going to pack up and move to Colorado.</p>
			<p>That meant the dog business was no longer happening since the place we were moving to was pretty small. My wife sees what I do and was curious if she could do something similar. Of course she could! Anybody could, but this meant that I had to teach her.</p>
			<p>So I decided that her and my brother should start a fitness site because they are fitness nerds. This was going to be how I teach them about making money online.</p>
			<p>And guess what? Obstacle.co was created to also share the experience with you.</p>
			<p><strong>I&rsquo;ll be sharing my experience of making money with blogs, running a service-based business, and creating online software products.</strong> Yes, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of stuff to try to keep a roof over my head and food on the table, but it isn&rsquo;t stuff that you wouldn&rsquo;t do yourself.</p>
			<p>So if you&rsquo;re ready to have a bit more control of your life then this is the place to be. Obstacle.co is launching later this week so be sure to sign up below so you do not miss a thing.</p>
