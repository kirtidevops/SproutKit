            <p>Before you could put an ad in the YellowPages, on the radio, or TV and expect that it will work. That stuff doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
            <p>There are just too many brands trying to grab people&rsquo;s attention to the point where people have automatically shut off any ads they see.</p>
            <p>People expect more from brands and their is only so much mindshare to go around. It is important that you claim a spot by showcasing your brand as one that provides unlimited value to people.</p>
            <p>Once you do this you are no longer just a business trying to make money, but a business looking to better the lives of everyone it serves.</p>
            <p>The key is consistency. How do you handle your social media presence? Does it follow a content strategy or do you just post to it because everyone else says you should?</p>
